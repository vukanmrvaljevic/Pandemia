Covid-19 is a resource for those interested in learning more about the pandemic. The website provides visitors with information, such as how to best protect themselves and others, live stats on global infection and mortality, and how they can help communities in need. I used HTML and CSS to work on the front-end portion of the website. The website can be viewed here: https://wizardly-pasteur-cadc61.netlify.app/
